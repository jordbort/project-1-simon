# Project 1: Simon (sus version)
This is my first project for General Assembly's Software Engineering immersive program! It is a Simon-like game in the style of the long task in reactor from the game "Among Us". You can play it at this deployed page link: https://jordbort.github.io/project-1-simon/

## Screenshots

The page opens with a "Start reactor" button, that turns yellow when the mouse hovers over it.

Like in the original task from Among Us, the green lights on the left panel indicate which round the player is on.

While the computer shows the player the pattern, the player's buttons are grayed out and disabled.

If the player clicks the correct button, it blinks cyan. For each correct button the player clicks, a green light is lit up on the right panel.

If the player clicks the wrong button, all the buttons and lights blink red three times, and the game resets with a new pattern.

If the player completes the game, the text "Task Completed!" slides up on the screen, and both the text and game panels move off-screen.

After the game is finished, a "Play again?" button appears on screen for the player to click on, if they wish to replay the game.

## Technologies Index
* HTML

## Getting Started
In order to play the game, please click the deployed link above, or download all the included files to a folder and open the `index.html` file. Click the "Start reactor" button to begin! If you finish the game, you have the option to play again by clicking the "Replay?" button.

## Next Steps
Here are some additional updates/enhancements I have in mind for the future:
* Additional CSS styling/media queries for greater consistency across devices
* Background hum of The Skeld, and additional sound effects
* Replacing the background image with an animated gif
