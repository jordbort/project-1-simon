# Project 1: Simon (sus version)
This is my first project for General Assembly's Software Engineering immersive program! It is a Simon-like game in the style of the long task in reactor from the game "Among Us".

## Getting Started
In order to play the game, please download all the included files to a folder, and open the `index.html` file. Click the "Start reactor" button to begin! If you finish the game, you have the option to play again by clicking the "Replay?" button.

## Next Steps
Here are some additional updates/enhancements I have in mind for the future:
* Additional CSS styling/media queries for greater consistency across devices
