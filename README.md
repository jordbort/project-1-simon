# Project 1: Simon
This is my first project for General Assembly's Software Engineering immersive program. It is a Simon-like game in the style of the long task in reactor from the game Among Us (sus).

## User story
* The user should see a landing page with a clickable object to start the game.
* The user should see two panels appear: a 3x3 game grid on the right, and a screen to follow on the left, both with 5 lights to indicate their progress.
* For round 1, the user should see one of the nine squares light up on the left-hand screen, which they should click on the corresponding game board on the right-hand side.
* If the user clicks on the wrong square, they will see the lights flash to indicate the mistake, and the game will reset.
* If the user clicks the correct square, the game progresses to round 2.
* For round 2, the user should see two squares light up in sequence, which they must click in the correct order to advance to the next round.
* Rounds 3-5 should continue in this manner.
* If the user completes round 5 with all squares clicked in the correct sequence, they have won the game.
* The user should see a victory screen, with a clickable button to play the game again.
